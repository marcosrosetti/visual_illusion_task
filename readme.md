Visual Illusion Task
-----------------------
-----------------------

This task presents a series two-alternative forced choice trials using the PsychoPy. 
All tests were designed to perform on a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 15.6” screen laptops, with 1920 x 1080 screen resolution.
Voiced instructions are in Spanish.

During the test two images were presented in each trial, one on each side of the screen on white background, 
and the task was to choose one according to the pre-recorded verbal and written instructions. 
For each participant, the test consisted a total 103 trial illusory picture pairs belonging to one of the 5 illusions tested 
(24 Ebbinghaus, 24 Müller-Lyer, 20 contrast, 10 moving snake, and 25 subjective contour). The Ebbinghaus, Müller-Lyer and 
Contrast illusions were presented in control, congruent and incongruent conditions in equal numbers. 
In the Control conditions the factors responsible for the illusory effect were similar on both sides. 
Congruent and Incongruent are both illusory conditions. In the Incongruent condition the factors responsible 
for the illusory effect are arranged such that the illusory effect facilitate correct choices, whereas in the 
Congruent condition the illusory effect acts against correct the choice. The Moving Snakes and Kanizsa illusions 
only had the illusion condition.

Müller-Lyer
	
Control. Target lines of different lengths, delimited by fins pointing inward or outward on both sides. 
Incongruent. The longer target line appears even longer with the fins pointing outward, the shorter target line appears even shorter with the fins pointing inward. 
Congruent. The longer target line appears shorter with the fins pointing inward, the shorter target line appears longer with the fins pointing outward. 

Ebbinghaus 
	
Control. Target circles of different sizes are surrounded by outer circles of the same size (smaller than both or larger than both) on each side. 
Incongruent. The larger target circle surrounded by smaller circles appears even larger. The smaller inner circle appears even smaller for surrounded by larger outer circles. 
Congruent. The larger target circle surrounded by larger circles appears smaller. The smaller inner circle appears larger for surrounded by smaller outer circles. 

Contrast 

Control. Internal circles have different shades of gray, while their surroundings have the same luminance (darker than both or lighter than both). 
Incongruent. The darker internal circle presented on light surrounding appears even darker, while the lighter internal circle presented on dark surrounding appears even lighter.   
Congruent. The darker internal circle presented on dark surrounding appears lighter, while the lighter internal circle presented on light surrounding appears darker.   

Kanizsa 
	
Four “Pacman” in a 7x7 grid form subjective contour of a square on one or the other side of the screen. 
The participant must choose the side of the screen on which the subjective contour was complete. 

Moving Snake 
	
A pair of images is presented of Moving Snake figures that have different contrast difference between their segments. 
Participant should choose the side when they perceive more movement. 

Illusions were always presented in groups. 
The presentation order of the illusions and presentation of the trials for each illusion was randomized. 
To control for laterality bias is necesary to change the blocks and reverse the directions 
For each set, vocal and written instructions were given at the start of the set and repeated in short form for each trial 
(i.e., choose the largest, darkest, that moves the most, which contains the square). 

It includes a series of probe trials desigened to familiarize participants with the equipment and to check that they understand the task, 
can distinguish basic differences (size, color, contrast) and can properly operate a computer mouse. 
If these probe trials were successfully answered, the participant could proceed to the visual illusion trials.  

Each trial lasted for a maximum of 15 seconds; if the participant did not make a choice, 
it moved to the next one. No feedback was provided during the trials.
